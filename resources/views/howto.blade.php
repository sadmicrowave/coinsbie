						Many people think cryptocurrencies are equal in value.  They see that Bitcoin reached $18,000.00, when it started at just a few pennies a couple of years ago.  They think any coin that is worth pennies today could eventually be $18,000.00 or more.
						<br><br>
						But this isn't how the cryptocurrency market works.  The value of your investment may only go as high as $3.00, or it may go up above $1,000.00. 
						<br><br>
						This is determined by 2 primary items:
						<br><br>
						<ul class="list-group">
						  <li class="list-group-item">
						  	1) How much supply is there of the cryptocurrency? 
						  </li>
						  <li class="list-group-item">
						  	2) How many people have already invested in that cryptocurrency?
						  </li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						If you want further details on this you can research how <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/031703.asp">Market Capitalization</a> works.  The Coinsbie Calculator does all the work for you by determining how much your investment would be worth if that coin reached Bitcoinâ€™s current market cap.  With this calculation you have a potential maximum value a cryptocurrency could be worth.
						<br><br>
						This maximum value indicates the best rate of return, or return on investment you can hope to get with this cryptocurrency.  Normally a coin will not reach that level, but knowing the maximum value for your investment might help you make smarter decisions on what cryptocurrency to invest in, and when.
						<br><br>
						For additional information and examples of how the Coinsbie Calculator works, read through the <a href='about'>About Page</a>.
						<br><br>
						Good luck investing!
