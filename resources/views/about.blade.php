							<li class="list-group-item">Like many of you, our friends and us joined the cryptocurrency world in 2017.  
														We dove into learn as much as we could.  We joined forums, researched websites to get the latest and greatest info on coins, 
														and downloaded apps that could give us news on the next coin to research. While scanning through all of this information we 
														noticed a common and recurring theme: people, particularly new investors, were constantly posting comments like:
							</li>
							<li class="list-group-item disabled">“How much can this coin be worth?”</li>
							<li class="list-group-item disabled">“Can Ripple reach $10,000?”</li>
							<li class="list-group-item disabled">“What is the coin that will give me 100x my investment?”</li>
							<li class="list-group-item disabled">“What coin can give me the best return on investment?”</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						
						The majority of the time these questions would either go unanswered, or be answered in frustration 
						by an experienced investor saying, “Go look at the market cap!!”  Most coin noobs out there 
						either don’t understand market capitalization or just want instant information for their coins 
						potential growth without doing much work.
						<br><br>
						
						This is what sparked the idea for Coinsbie. It is a simple tool to calculate what a cryptocurrency’s maximum 
						potential value if it reached Bitcoin’s current value.  No more need to annoy people on forums with those basic questions!
						<br><br>
						
						For those of you who understand how to do this calculation already, you may be wondering why you would ever use Coinsbie. 
						The Coinsbie calculation is fairly simple math based on current market cap values.  Anyone can do this manually, but as you 
						know, the value and market cap of coins constantly change. This means you have to constantly look up the most recent market cap 
						of both: your coin that you are researching, and Bitcoin’s current market cap.  We got tired of doing this over-and-over so we 
						created this tool that does it for us in a matter of seconds. I hope this tool can make your life a bit more efficient as well!
						<br><br>
						
						<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
							Note: Coinsbie is based on the current value of Bitcoin.  When using the Coinsbie Calculator don't expect that a coin will reach 
							Bitcoin’s value over night, or even the next few months. The Coinsbie tool is something to use when you want to invest early and 
							wait for a coins value to rise. See our <a href="howto">How To Page</a> to learn more about how we use this tool.
